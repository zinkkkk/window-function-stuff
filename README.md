Varius bits of code playing around with various window functions and some signal processing stuff.
Lots of the code is pretty bad/broken so don't take any of it too seriously it's a bit of a mess, check over everything before using any of this in production.
Some sections had a bit of AI use (mostly the DPSS stuff).

The main interesting things here are:

DPSS window using faer to generate coefficients.

Fractional kaiser window using the fractional modified Bessel function of the first kind mentioned in these papers:
